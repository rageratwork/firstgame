# Baby's First Game

**Baby's First Game** is a game designed for kids from infants to preschool. They will have fun learning about colors, shapes, numbers and letters. The skill levels are very customizable and can grow with your child. This game was inspired by [Baby Smash](http://www.hanselman.com/babysmash/) by Scott Hanselman and by watching the games my own kids were interested in.
